Episode 9: The Clay Tablets from Babylon 

In this episode, Mathon, a moneylender in Babylon, imparted a valuable lesson to his son, Rodan. 
He showed him the ancient clay tablets from Babylon, which recorded loans, repayments, and interest rates.

These clay tablets served as a reminder of the importance of the  Seventh Cure for a Lean Purse :
 ensuring a future income. Mathon explained to Rodan that setting aside a portion of one's earnings for the future, 
especially for retirement, was crucial for financial security.

He emphasized the importance of keeping accurate financial records, just as the Babylonians did with their clay tablets. 
Rodan learned that by planning for the future and maintaining meticulous financial records, he could build lasting wealth and security.
