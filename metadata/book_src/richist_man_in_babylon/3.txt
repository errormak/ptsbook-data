Episode 2: The Richest Man in Babylon 

As Arkad continued his lessons, Bansir and Kobbi eagerly sought to grasp the principles of wealth. 
Arkad shared his personal journey, how he had started as a simple scribe but had become the richest man in Babylon.

He explained the  Second Cure for a Lean Purse,  which involved putting the saved money to work. Arkad emphasized that money, 
like a slave, could work for its master and earn more money. He encouraged Bansir and the others to invest their saved earnings wisely, ensuring they grew over time.

Arkad's words resonated deeply with the young men. They understood that merely saving money was not enough; 
it had to be invested in ventures that promised a return on their investments.
