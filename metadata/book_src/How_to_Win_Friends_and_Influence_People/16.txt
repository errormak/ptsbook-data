Frankl introduces the concept of constructive criticism, emphasizing that criticism can be a valuable tool for growth when delivered with care and empathy.

Frankl highlights the importance of empathy and understanding when providing feedback. He encourages us to put ourselves in the shoes of the person receiving criticism, recognizing their humanity and vulnerabilities.

5. Recognizing Potential:
Frankl suggests that constructive criticism should focus on helping individuals recognize their untapped potential. Instead of tearing someone down, it should inspire them to grow and develop.
