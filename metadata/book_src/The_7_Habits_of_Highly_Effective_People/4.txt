Episode 2: The First Habit: Be Proactive

Covey's first habit,  Be Proactive,  introduces the idea that we have the power to choose our responses to external stimuli, regardless of the circumstances. 
He argues that true effectiveness begins with recognizing that we are response-ableâ€”able to respond thoughtfully and intentionally to the situations we encounter.

Proactivity involves understanding the difference between our Circle of Concern (things we care about but have little control over) and our Circle of Influence 
(things we can control or influence). Covey encourages us to focus our time and energy on our Circle of Influence, where we can make a significant impact.

He introduces the concept of  response-ability,  emphasizing that between stimulus and response, there is a gap where we can choose our response based on our 
values and principles. By being proactive, we take control of our actions, attitudes, and behaviors, paving the way for personal growth and effectiveness.
