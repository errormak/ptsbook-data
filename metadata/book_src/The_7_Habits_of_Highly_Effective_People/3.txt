Episode 1: Paradigms and Principles

In the opening chapter of  The 7 Habits,  Stephen R. Covey introduces us to the fundamental concepts that underpin his philosophy of personal effectiveness: 
paradigms and principles. He explains that paradigms are the lenses through which we view the world—the mental maps that shape our perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. 
These paradigms are often deeply ingrained and influence our decision-making.

Covey emphasizes the importance of examining and, if necessary, shifting our paradigms to align with enduring principles—timeless truths about human behavior 
and effectiveness. Principles are the bedrock upon which personal and professional success is built. They include integrity, honesty, humility, empathy, 
and the Golden Rule: treating others as we wish to be treated.

By understanding the power of paradigms and embracing universal principles, individuals can transform their lives from the inside out. 
This insight sets the stage for the journey through the seven habits, guiding us to become more proactive in shaping our destinies.
