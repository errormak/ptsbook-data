Episode 4: The Third Habit: Put First Things First

In the third habit,  Put First Things First,  Covey explores the art of time management and prioritization. He introduces the Time Management Matrix, 
which categorizes tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance.

Covey argues that many people spend too much time on urgent but unimportant tasks (Quadrant I) or on non-urgent, unimportant tasks (Quadrant III),
 often neglecting the truly important but non-urgent tasks (Quadrant II). The key to effectiveness, he suggests, is to prioritize Quadrant II activities.

To put first things first, Covey introduces the concept of  Quadrant II focus,  which involves dedicating time to activities that are not urgent but have 
a significant impact on our long-term goals. This habit helps individuals become more proactive and focused on what truly matters, allowing them to achieve 
their objectives while reducing stress and firefighting.
