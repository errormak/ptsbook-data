Episode 11: The Elixir of Life 

The alchemist shares the concept of the  Elixir of Life  with Santiago. He explains that the Elixir is not a physical substance but a spiritual realization 
that one can achieve when they are in harmony with the Soul of the World. The alchemist emphasizes that the pursuit of the Elixir is not about immortality 
in the physical sense but about achieving a sense of oneness with the universe and embracing the eternal cycle of life and death. Santiago reflects on the 
profound meaning of this lesson as they continue their journey.
