Episode 6: Teach What You Know

In  Chapter 6: Teach What You Know,  Austin Kleon underscores the power of sharing knowledge and expertise as a means of both learning and building a community around your creative work.

Kleon believes that teaching what you know is not only a generous act but also a valuable way to solidify your own understanding of a subject. When you teach others, you're forced to articulate your ideas clearly, answer questions, and synthesize your knowledge. This process can deepen your own expertise and help you refine your creative practice.

The chapter encourages creators to consider various ways to share their knowledge, such as writing tutorials, creating how-to videos, leading workshops, or simply sharing insights on their blogs or social media platforms. By doing so, you become a valuable resource for others who are interested in your area of expertise.

Kleon also highlights the importance of authenticity in teaching. You don't need to pretend to have all the answers; it's okay to be a  learner-teacher  who shares what you've learned so far. This approach can make your teaching more relatable and accessible to others.
