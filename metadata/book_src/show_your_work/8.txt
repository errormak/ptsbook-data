Episode 7: Don't Turn into Human Spam

In  Chapter 7: Don't Turn into Human Spam,  Austin Kleon addresses the delicate balance between sharing one's creative work and becoming overly self-promotional. This chapter offers guidance on how to avoid overwhelming your audience with excessive self-promotion and maintain authenticity in your sharing.

Kleon acknowledges that in the digital age, there's a fine line between promoting your work and bombarding people with constant self-promotion. He advocates for finding the right frequency and tone in sharing. It's important to avoid turning into what he calls  human spam,  where your online presence becomes dominated by relentless self-promotion.

The chapter encourages creators to share not just their own work but also the work of others they admire. By curating and promoting the work of others, you contribute to a larger creative ecosystem and demonstrate your genuine interest in the creative community.

Kleon advises against constantly asking for favors or attention from your audience. Instead, he suggests focusing on offering value through your sharingâ€”whether it's entertaining, informative, or thought-provoking content. By providing value, you naturally attract an audience interested in your work.

This chapter also highlights the importance of reciprocity. When you support and engage with others in a meaningful way, they are more likely to reciprocate by supporting your work. Genuine engagement, such as leaving thoughtful comments, sharing insights, and participating in discussions, can foster a sense of community.
