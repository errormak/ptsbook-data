Episode 5: Tell Good Stories

In  Chapter 5: Tell Good Stories,  Austin Kleon emphasizes the power of storytelling as a means of sharing one's creative work effectively. Kleon believes that storytelling is a fundamental way to connect with an audience on a deeper level and make your work more relatable and engaging.

This chapter highlights that stories have a unique ability to captivate and connect with people emotionally. Kleon suggests that creators should not only share the details of their creative process but also narrate the journey, complete with challenges, triumphs, and personal insights.
