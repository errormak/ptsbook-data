Episode 2: Think Process, Not Product

In  Chapter 2: Think Process, Not Product,  Austin Kleon challenges the common notion that creative work should be shared only when it's finished and polished. Instead, he advocates for sharing the creative process itselfâ€”showcasing the steps, drafts, and incremental progress that lead to the final product.

Kleon suggests that focusing solely on the end result can be intimidating and overwhelming. Many creatives hesitate to share their work until it meets their perceived standards of perfection. However, this chapter urges a shift in perspective. Kleon believes that sharing the process can be more engaging and relatable to an audience.

By revealing the steps taken to create a piece of work, artists and creators allow their audience to connect with the human side of the creative process. It makes the journey more relatable and can inspire others to embark on their own creative endeavors.

Kleon encourages readers to document their creative processes, whether through sketches, drafts, or journal entries, and share them with their audience. By doing so, they invite others to join them on the journey, ask questions, and offer insights.

This chapter introduces the idea that sharing the process is a way to establish a deeper connection with an audience and create a sense of community around one's work. It also emphasizes that perfection is not a prerequisite for sharing; vulnerability and authenticity can be far more engaging.
