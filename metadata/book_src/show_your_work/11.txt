Episode 10: Stick Around

In  Chapter 10: Stick Around,  Austin Kleon underscores the importance of long-term commitment to your creative journey and maintaining a sustained presence in the creative world.

Kleon argues that creative success is not just about a single breakthrough or viral moment but about the cumulative effect of consistently sharing your work over time. He encourages creators to view their creative practice as a lifelong journey rather than a short-term endeavor.

This chapter emphasizes the idea of  sticking around  by continuously creating and sharing your work, even when the immediate rewards may be limited. Kleon believes that creators should focus on the long-term impact of their work and the legacy they are building.

Kleon also explores the concept of  creative lineage  â€” the idea that your work can influence and inspire future generations of artists and creators. By sticking around and continuing to create, you contribute to the ongoing creative conversation and leave a lasting mark on your field.

The chapter encourages creators to resist the urge to chase trends or follow fleeting fads and instead stay true to their unique voice and vision. It's about finding your niche and consistently producing work that aligns with your passion and values.

Kleon provides practical advice on how to maintain a sustained presence in the creative world, including the importance of maintaining a digital archive of your work, regularly updating your portfolio, and nurturing relationships within the creative community.
