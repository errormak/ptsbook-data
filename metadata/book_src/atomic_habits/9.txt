Episode 8: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

Clear discusses the importance of consistency in building habits. He emphasizes that progress may be slow, but it should always move forward. 
Habits are best developed through gradual, sustainable changes rather than radical, short-lived efforts.

Clear introduces the concept of the  Valley of Disappointment,  which represents the period of time when it may seem like your efforts aren't 
yielding significant results. He encourages readers to persist through this phase, as it's often followed by the  Plateau of Latent Potential,  
where progress accelerates.
