Part 6: Prospect Theory

Episode 25: Risk and Losses

In Part 6, Kahneman delves into the complex world of risk and losses, continuing the exploration of Prospect Theory. He discusses how individuals perceive and respond to risks and how they differ in their attitudes towards potential gains and losses.

Kahneman explains that people tend to be risk-averse when facing potential gains, preferring certainty over uncertainty. However, when it comes to potential losses, they become risk-seeking, often taking bigger risks to avoid certain losses.

Through experiments and real-life examples, Kahneman illustrates how these attitudes towards risk and loss can influence various decision-making scenarios, from investing to everyday choices. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for recognizing the nuanced ways in which people assess and manage risks in different contexts.
