Episode 10: How Judgments Happen (Continued)

In this episode, Kahneman delves deeper into the concept of  heuristics and biases  introduced in Episode 8. He explores how heuristics, which are mental shortcuts, and biases, systematic errors in judgment, play a significant role in our decision-making processes.

Kahneman discusses the confirmation bias, where people tend to seek out and favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. He also explores the anchoring effect, where initial information (an anchor) influences subsequent judgments, even if the anchor is arbitrary or irrelevant.

Through examples and experiments, Kahneman illustrates how these biases can lead to errors in judgment and decision-making. Understanding these cognitive processes is essential for recognizing when our thinking may be influenced by biases and for making more informed and rational choices.
