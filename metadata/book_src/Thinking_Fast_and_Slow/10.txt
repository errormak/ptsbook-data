Episode 9: Answering an Easier Question

In this episode, Kahneman continues to explore how people make judgments by discussing the concept of substitution. He explains that when faced with a difficult question, our minds often substitute it with a simpler, related question that is easier to answer. This mental shortcut can lead to errors in judgment.

Kahneman illustrates the substitution process with examples from everyday life, such as job interviews and evaluations. He also introduces the concept of the  planning fallacy,  where people tend to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions or projects.

Understanding how our minds substitute simpler questions for complex ones provides valuable insights into the cognitive processes that underlie our judgments and decisions. It highlights the need for critical thinking and awareness of the shortcuts our minds often take when making judgments.
