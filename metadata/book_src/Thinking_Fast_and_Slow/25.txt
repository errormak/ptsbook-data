Episode 24: The Colonoscopy Study

In this episode, Kahneman delves into a study involving colonoscopy procedures and the interplay between the Experiencing Self and the Remembering Self. He discusses how the timing of discomfort during the procedure influenced patients' memories of the overall experience.

Kahneman presents the notion of the  peak-end rule,  which suggests that people's memories of an experience are heavily influenced by how they felt at the most intense moment (the peak) and how they felt at the end. He explains how this rule can lead to unexpected outcomes in healthcare decisions and patient satisfaction.

The colonoscopy study serves as a compelling example of how the Remembering Self can dominate our choices, often disregarding the duration and intensity of discomfort during the actual experience. Understanding the peak-end rule and its impact on decision-making is crucial for assessing the trade-offs between momentary discomfort and long-term well-being.
