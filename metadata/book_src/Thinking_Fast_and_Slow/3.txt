Episode 2: Attention and Effort

In the second episode, Kahneman dives deeper into the characteristics of System 1 and System 2. He introduces the idea that System 1 is always  on  and continuously scanning the environment for potential threats and opportunities. It operates effortlessly and automatically, requiring minimal cognitive effort.

However, System 2, being the deliberate and analytical thinker, demands more cognitive resources and effort. It engages when we encounter situations that demand our full attention and conscious thought. For example, solving a complex math problem or learning a new skill activates System 2.

Kahneman illustrates how System 1 and System 2 work together, with System 1 often generating quick impressions and intuitions while System 2 can override these automatic responses with careful analysis. This interplay between the two systems shapes our daily decision-making and judgments.
