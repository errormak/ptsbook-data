Episode 17: The Science of Surprise

In this episode, Kahneman explores the concept of predictability and how it relates to overconfidence. He discusses how people tend to underestimate the predictability of events and attribute too much importance to surprising or unexpected outcomes.

Kahneman presents experiments and real-life scenarios to illustrate how individuals often fail to recognize the role of chance and randomness in events. This cognitive bias can lead to unwarranted confidence in one's ability to predict and control outcomes.

Understanding the science of surprise is crucial for acknowledging the limits of human prediction and recognizing when our judgments may be swayed by the allure of surprising events. It underscores the importance of probabilistic thinking and acknowledging the role of chance in our lives.
