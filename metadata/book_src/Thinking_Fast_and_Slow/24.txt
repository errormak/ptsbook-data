Episode 23: Duration Neglect

In this episode, Kahneman explores the concept of  duration neglect,  a phenomenon where the length of an experience has little influence on our memory of it. He provides examples and experiments to demonstrate how people often prioritize the peak moments and endings of an experience when forming memories.

Kahneman discusses how duration neglect can lead to paradoxical outcomes, where people may choose longer, less pleasant experiences over shorter, more pleasant ones because of how they remember them. This cognitive bias has implications for decision-making and our pursuit of happiness.

Understanding duration neglect highlights the importance of considering how we remember experiences when making choices. It underscores the need to be mindful of the biases that affect our decisions, especially when evaluating the quality of experiences over time
