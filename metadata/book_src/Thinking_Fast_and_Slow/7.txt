Episode 6: Norms, Surprises, and Causes

In this episode, Kahneman explores how human judgment and decision-making are often guided by social norms, expectations, and the influence of others. He introduces the concept of  substitution,  where our minds replace difficult questions with simpler ones that are easier to answer.

Kahneman discusses the importance of understanding the reference points and frames that shape our perceptions and judgments. He explains how people often rely on the context in which information is presented to make decisions, leading to predictable biases such as the framing effect.

The episode also touches on the role of causality in human thinking. Kahneman emphasizes that our minds are naturally inclined to seek causes and explanations for events, even when they may not be evident. This tendency to infer causality can lead to errors in judgment, as we often attribute outcomes to causes that may not be valid.

Kahneman's exploration of these cognitive processes highlights the complexity of human decision-making and the influence of external factors on our judgments. It underscores the importance of critical thinking and awareness of how our minds can be led astray by social norms and contextual cues.
