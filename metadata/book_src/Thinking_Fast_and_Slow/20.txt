Part 4: Choices

Episode 19: Prospect Theory

In Part 4, Kahneman delves into the realm of choices and introduces the concept of Prospect Theory. He explains how individuals tend to evaluate potential outcomes of decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than absolute values.

Kahneman discusses how people are risk-averse when considering potential gains but risk-seeking when facing potential losses. This asymmetry in decision-making can lead to deviations from traditional economic models.

Understanding Prospect Theory is essential for recognizing how emotions and framing can influence decision-making. It emphasizes the idea that our evaluation of choices is often driven by the context and reference points we establish, impacting our risk preferences.
