Episode 31: The Planning Fallacy

In Part 8, Kahneman delves deeper into the concept of the Two Selves â€“ the Experiencing Self and the Remembering Self. He discusses the  planning fallacy,  a cognitive bias where individuals tend to underestimate the time, costs, and risks associated with future actions and overestimate the benefits.

Kahneman provides examples and experiments that highlight how people often make overly optimistic predictions about their future actions and outcomes. He explains how the planning fallacy can lead to unrealistic plans and decisions.

Understanding the planning fallacy is essential for recognizing the challenges of accurate forecasting and decision-making. It underscores the need to consider historical data and expert opinions when making predictions and planning for the future.
