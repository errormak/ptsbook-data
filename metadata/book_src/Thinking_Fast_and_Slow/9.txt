Episode 8: How Judgments Happen

In this episode, Kahneman delves into the process of making judgments and explores the factors that influence how we perceive events and situations. He introduces the concept of  heuristics and biases,  which are mental shortcuts and systematic errors that affect our thinking.

Kahneman discusses the availability heuristic, where people tend to rely on information that is readily available to them when making judgments. He also introduces the representativeness heuristic, which involves making judgments based on how closely something resembles a prototype or stereotype.

Through examples and experiments, Kahneman illustrates how these heuristics can lead to errors in judgment and how our minds often substitute simpler questions for more complex ones when making decisions. This episode sheds light on the cognitive processes that shape our judgments and introduces the idea of cognitive biases.
