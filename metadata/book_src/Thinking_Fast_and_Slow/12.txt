Episode 11: Overconfidence

In this episode, Kahneman delves into the concept of overconfidence, a common cognitive bias where people tend to overestimate their own abilities, knowledge, and the accuracy of their judgments. He explores how overconfidence affects various aspects of life, from financial decisions to predictions about the future.

Kahneman discusses the idea of the  inside view  and the  outside view  when making predictions. The inside view involves considering specific details and factors related to a particular situation, often leading to overconfidence. The outside view, on the other hand, involves looking at similar cases or statistics to make more objective predictions.

Through experiments and real-world examples, Kahneman highlights the pervasive nature of overconfidence and its impact on decision-making. He emphasizes the importance of adopting the outside view to mitigate the effects of overconfidence and make more accurate judgments
