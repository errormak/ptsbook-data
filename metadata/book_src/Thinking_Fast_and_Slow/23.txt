Part 5: Two Selves

Episode 22: The Two Selves

In Part 5, Kahneman introduces the concept of  Two Selves  â€“ the Experiencing Self and the Remembering Self. He explores how these two aspects of our consciousness perceive and remember experiences differently.

Kahneman discusses the Experiencing Self, which lives in the present moment and evaluates experiences based on how they feel in real-time. On the other hand, the Remembering Self focuses on creating coherent narratives of our lives, influenced by peak moments and how experiences end.

Through examples and experiments, Kahneman illustrates how our memories are constructed, often prioritizing peak moments and endings over the overall experience. Understanding the distinction between the Experiencing and Remembering Selves sheds light on how we perceive and remember our lives.
