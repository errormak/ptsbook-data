Episode 20: The Endowment Effect

In this episode, Kahneman explores the concept of the endowment effect, a cognitive bias where people tend to overvalue objects or assets simply because they possess them. He discusses how this bias can lead to irrational economic decisions and attachment to possessions.

Kahneman presents experiments that demonstrate how individuals often demand a higher price to part with something they own than they would be willing to pay to acquire the same item. This behavior contradicts traditional economic assumptions and highlights the role of ownership in influencing perceived value.

Understanding the endowment effect is crucial for recognizing how our emotional attachment to possessions can impact our choices and economic transactions. It sheds light on the complexities of decision-making related to ownership and loss aversion.
