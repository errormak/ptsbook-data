Episode 18: The Hindsight Bias

In this episode, Kahneman explores the hindsight bias, a cognitive bias where people tend to see events as having been predictable after they have occurred. He discusses how this bias can lead to distorted judgments of the past and overconfidence in our ability to predict future events.

Kahneman provides examples and experiments that demonstrate how people tend to remember events as having been more predictable than they were perceived at the time. This bias can affect how we evaluate past decisions and make us believe that we knew the outcome all along.

Understanding the hindsight bias is crucial for recognizing how our memory of events can be influenced by overconfidence and the desire for neat narratives. It emphasizes the need for humility in evaluating past decisions and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting future outcomes.
