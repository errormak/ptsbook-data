Episode 5: Cognitive Ease

In this episode, Kahneman introduces the concept of  cognitive ease  and explores how it influences our thinking and decision-making. Cognitive ease refers to the mental state where thinking feels effortless and familiar. It occurs when System 1 is dominant, and information flows smoothly.

Kahneman explains that cognitive ease can lead to a sense of confidence in our judgments, even if they are based on flawed or biased thinking. When things feel easy, we tend to trust our intuitions and impressions without subjecting them to critical scrutiny.

Conversely, cognitive strain occurs when System 2 is engaged, demanding effort and attention. Kahneman discusses how this state of cognitive strain can lead to doubt and skepticism, prompting us to question our judgments and seek additional information.

Understanding the dynamics of cognitive ease and cognitive strain is crucial for recognizing when our thinking may be influenced by the ease of processing information rather than the accuracy of the information itself. It sheds light on the factors that shape our confidence in our judgments.
