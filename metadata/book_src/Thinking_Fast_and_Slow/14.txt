Episode 13: The Law of Small Numbers

In Part 2, Kahneman delves into the fascinating world of heuristics and biases, starting with  The Law of Small Numbers.  He explains how people tend to draw sweeping conclusions based on small sample sizes, an inclination he calls  the law of small numbers.  Kahneman explores how this cognitive bias affects various aspects of decision-making, from investment strategies to perceptions of risk.

Kahneman provides real-life examples and research findings to illustrate how our minds often generalize from limited information, leading to erroneous judgments. Understanding the implications of the law of small numbers is vital for recognizing when we may be making unwarranted assumptions based on insufficient data.
