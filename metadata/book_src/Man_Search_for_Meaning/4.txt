Episode 3: The Search for Meaning

Amidst the horrors of the concentration camp, Frankl began to formulate his ideas about the importance of finding meaning in life, even in the bleakest circumstances. This episode delves into Frankl's early thoughts on the significance of a sense of purpose as a driving force for survival. We explore how he observed that those who had a reason to live, a  why,  were more likely to endure the  how  of their suffering. Frankl's insights lay the foundation for the existential psychotherapy he would later develop, emphasizing the human capacity to find meaning and maintain one's inner freedom even in the face of external oppression.
