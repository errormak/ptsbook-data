Episode 3: Never Enough

In  The Psychology of Money  by Morgan Housel, the author delves into the concept of  Never Enough.  This chapter explores the psychological aspect of money and why many people tend to feel unsatisfied with their financial situation, regardless of how much wealth they accumulate.

Housel begins by highlighting that the pursuit of more money often becomes a never-ending cycle. Many individuals believe that once they reach a certain level of wealth, they will finally feel content. However, as they achieve their financial goals, new desires and aspirations emerge, and they find themselves continually chasing after  more. 

The author provides several real-life examples of wealthy individuals who never felt financially secure or satisfied, despite their substantial fortunes. This phenomenon is often referred to as the  hedonic treadmill,  where people adjust to their increased wealth and continuously seek more to maintain a certain level of happiness.

Housel also discusses the importance of defining what  enough  means to each individual. He emphasizes that personal financial satisfaction should not be solely tied to external benchmarks or comparisons to others. Instead, it should be rooted in one's own values, goals, and priorities.

Furthermore, the author highlights the significance of gratitude and contentment in achieving a sense of  enough.  He suggests that appreciating what one has and practicing contentment can lead to greater financial well-being and overall happiness.
