Episode 9: Wealth is What You Don't See

In  The Psychology of Money  by Morgan Housel, the concept of  Wealth is What You Don't See  delves into the often-overlooked aspects of financial success and how wealth is accumulated silently, away from the spotlight.

This idea revolves around the fact that true wealth isn't always ostentatious or flashy. Instead, it's often hidden in the everyday choices and behaviors that accumulate over time. Here are some key points to consider within this concept:

Savings and Frugality: Building wealth typically involves consistent savings and living within one's means. Wealthy individuals may appear frugal, making careful financial decisions that go unnoticed by others.

Compound Interest: Wealth is often generated quietly through the power of compound interest. Small, consistent investments grow exponentially over time, yet this process may be invisible to those around you.

Delayed Gratification: Wealthy individuals understand the value of delayed gratification. They may forego immediate pleasures to secure their financial future, which can appear unexciting or inconspicuous to others.

Risk Management: Part of accumulating wealth is managing risks and avoiding financial setbacks. This includes having an emergency fund, insurance, and diversified investments, which may not be apparent to outsiders.

Long-Term Perspective: Wealth builders tend to think long-term. They focus on financial goals that extend beyond the immediate future, which might not be evident in their day-to-day activities.
