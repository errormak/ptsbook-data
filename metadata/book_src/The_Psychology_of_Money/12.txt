Episode 11: Reasonable > Rational

In  The Psychology of Money  by Morgan Housel, the concept of  Reasonable > Rational  challenges traditional notions of rational economic behavior and highlights the role of being reasonable in financial decision-making. Here's a detailed exploration of this concept:

Emotions in Finance: The concept acknowledges that human beings are emotional creatures, and emotions often play a significant role in financial decision-making. While traditional economics assumes that individuals are rational actors who make logical choices, real-world decisions are often influenced by emotions like fear, greed, and overconfidence.

Risk and Reward: Being reasonable means understanding that people may take on more risk than traditional models predict because they have personal reasons for doing so. This could be pursuing higher returns to achieve specific financial goals or following investment strategies that align with their values and beliefs.

Long-Term Thinking: Rationality often focuses on short-term gain and loss, while being reasonable takes a broader view. Investors who are reasonable prioritize long-term financial health over short-term fluctuations in their portfolios. This mindset encourages patience and persistence in achieving financial goals.

Behavioral Finance: Behavioral economics and finance recognize that people may deviate from rational decision-making due to cognitive biases. Being reasonable means acknowledging these biases and adapting financial strategies to work with, rather than against, human psychology.

Personal Finance Rules: Reasonable financial decision-making often involves following personal finance rules of thumb, such as saving a percentage of income, diversifying investments, and avoiding excessive debt. These rules provide a practical framework for making reasonable financial choices.

Adaptability: Rational economic models assume that individuals make consistent, logical decisions over time. In contrast, being reasonable recognizes that people's financial decisions may evolve as their circumstances, priorities, and knowledge change.

Financial Literacy: Being reasonable also entails recognizing the importance of financial education and literacy. Informed decisions are more likely to be reasonable ones, and individuals can improve their financial decision-making by learning about investing, budgeting, and personal finance.
