In this episode, Clear explores the concept of daily habits and the importance of consistency. He introduces the concept of the  Seinfeld Strategy,  
named after the comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who famously committed to writing jokes every day. This strategy involves maintaining a visual chain of progress
