Episode 9: The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying

In Part 5, James Clear introduces the fourth and final law of behavior change:  Make It Satisfying.  
He discusses the importance of immediate and delayed gratification in habit formation. Making a habit satisfying involves receiving a reward or positive 
feedback that reinforces the behavior.

Clear emphasizes that the more immediate and pleasurable the reward, the more likely a habit will be repeated. He introduces the concept of  habit tracking  
as a means of visualizing progress and celebrating small wins. Tracking habits allows individuals to experience a sense of satisfaction and reinforces their 
commitment to positive behaviors.
