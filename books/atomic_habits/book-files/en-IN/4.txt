Episode 3: The 1st Law: Make It Obvious

Clear introduces the first of his four  laws  for behavior change:  Make It Obvious.  He stresses that habit formation begins with awareness. 
We must make our desired behaviors obvious in our environment, and conversely, make our unwanted behaviors less visible.

Clear discusses the concept of  habit stacking,  where we attach new habits to existing routines, making them easier to remember and follow. 
He also highlights the role of cues and triggers in habit formation and how to utilize them effectively.
