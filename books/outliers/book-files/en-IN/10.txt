Episode 9: Marita's Bargain

In  Marita's Bargain,  Malcolm Gladwell introduces us to the concept of  cultural legacies  and explores how they shape the opportunities and outcomes of individuals. 
He does this by examining the success of a particular group of students in the South Bronx, New York, and comparing it to the challenges faced by other students in 
more affluent areas.

The episode begins with the story of Marita, a young girl living in a disadvantaged neighborhood in the South Bronx. Despite facing numerous obstacles and attending 
a severely underfunded school, Marita excels academically and is part of a unique educational program known as KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program). 
KIPP provides its students with a longer school day and a longer school year, giving them more time to learn and catch up with their more privileged peers.

Gladwell discusses the idea that the success of KIPP students like Marita is due to the program's ability to instill a strong work ethic and a sense of urgency. 
By dedicating more time to education, these students develop habits of discipline and perseverance that set them apart from their peers.

Gladwell then introduces the concept of cultural legacies, which are the beliefs, values, and behaviors passed down from one generation to the next. 
He argues that KIPP students benefit from cultural legacies that emphasize hard work, discipline, and the importance of education. These legacies, instilled by 
their parents and the KIPP program, contribute to their academic success.

To highlight the significance of cultural legacies, Gladwell contrasts the experiences of KIPP students with those of children from more affluent backgrounds. 
He argues that the cultural legacies of affluent families often prioritize leisure and play over work and academic achievement. As a result, these students may not 
develop the same level of discipline and work ethic as their KIPP counterparts.
