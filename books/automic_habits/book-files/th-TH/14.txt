Episode 13: The Law of Least Effort

In Part 7, Clear examines the laws of behavior change that underlie habit formation. In this episode, he focuses on the "Law of Least Effort." 
Clear discusses how people naturally gravitate toward actions that require the least amount of effort. To establish good habits, one should make 
them as easy as possible to perform.

Clear introduces the concept of "habit stacking," a technique where you pair a new habit with an existing one to create a seamless routine. 
This approach minimizes the effort required to initiate the new habit. He also emphasizes the importance of incremental progress and starting small 
to overcome the resistance that often comes with new behaviors.
