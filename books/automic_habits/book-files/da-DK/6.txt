Episode 5: The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

In Part 3, James Clear introduces the second law of behavior change: "Make It Attractive." He explains that human behavior is often driven by the anticipation 
of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. To make a habit attractive, it should be associated with positive emotions and rewards.

Clear discusses the concept of "temptation bundling," which involves pairing a habit you want to develop with an activity you enjoy. 
By linking the habit to something you find attractive, you increase the likelihood of it becoming a regular part of your life. Clear also explores
 the role of immediate gratification and how it can be harnessed to reinforce good habits.
