Clear explores the concept of motivation in this episode, emphasizing that motivation often follows action rather than preceding it. 
He discusses how small wins and positive feedback can generate motivation and reinforce good habits.

Clear introduces the concept of "the Goldilocks Rule," which suggests that individuals are most motivated when they are working on tasks that are neither 
too easy nor too difficult but just the right level of challenge. He provides strategies for staying motivated and maintaining momentum in the pursuit of one's goals.
