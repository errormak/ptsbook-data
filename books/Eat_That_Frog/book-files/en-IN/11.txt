Episode 10: Take It One Oil Barrel at a Time

In Brian Tracy's  Eat That Frog!  book, the concept  Take It One Oil Barrel at a Time  emphasizes the importance of breaking down large, intimidating tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This approach can make even the most challenging projects seem achievable. Here's how you can apply this concept in your daily life:

As you complete each step, take a moment to acknowledge your progress and celebrate your achievements. This can boost your motivation.
