Episode 5: Practice Creative Procrastination

In Brian Tracy's  Eat That Frog!  book, the fifth concept is  Practice Creative Procrastination.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, this concept doesn't encourage laziness but rather focuses on prioritization and time management. Here's how practicing creative procrastination can improve your productivity:

1. Identify Low-Value Tasks: Creative procrastination involves consciously postponing or eliminating tasks that have low or no value in achieving your goals. Not all tasks are created equal, and some may not be worth your time.

2. Focus on High-Value Tasks: By procrastinating on less important tasks, you free up more time and mental energy to concentrate on high-value tasks that have a significant impact on your objectives.

3. Use the 80/20 Rule: The 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle) suggests that 20% of your efforts yield 80% of your results. Identify the tasks within that 20% and prioritize them while creatively procrastinating on the less impactful ones.

4. Say  No  More Often: Part of creative procrastination is learning to say  no  to tasks, commitments, or distractions that don't align with your goals. This allows you to protect your time and focus on what truly matters.

5. Consider Long-Term Benefits: When you creatively procrastinate on short-term or less important tasks, you're making a conscious decision to invest your time in activities that will bring long-term benefits.

6. Delegate or Outsource: Sometimes, creative procrastination involves delegating tasks to others or outsourcing them to free yourself for more strategic work. This is especially useful if you have the resources available.

7. Eliminate Time-Wasting Activities: Be aware of activities that consume your time without adding value to your life or work. Creative procrastination can help you identify and cut down on these activities.

8. Maintain Focus and Prioritization: Regularly reassess your tasks and priorities to ensure you're not getting caught up in busywork. Creative procrastination keeps you focused on what truly matters.
