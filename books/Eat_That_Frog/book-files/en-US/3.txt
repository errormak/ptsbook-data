Episode 2: Plan Every Day in Advance

Brian Tracy's  Eat That Frog!  continues with the second concept:  Plan Every Day in Advance.  This concept emphasizes the importance of proactive planning to boost productivity and achieve your goals.

Here are the key points of this concept:

1. Prioritization: Begin by identifying your most important tasks (MITs) for the day. These are the tasks that will have the most significant impact on your long-term goals and success. Remember the 80/20 rule, which suggests that 20% of your efforts will yield 80% of your results.

2. Time Management: Allocate specific time blocks for each task on your list. Set clear start and end times for your work. This prevents tasks from expanding to fill your entire day and ensures that you allocate time to your MITs.

3. Eliminate Time Wasters: Identify common time-wasting activities, such as excessive social media use, and limit or eliminate them. Use your time blocks for focused work.

4. Weekly Planning: In addition to daily planning, take time each week to plan your upcoming week. This allows you to see the bigger picture and ensure that you're consistently working toward your goals.

5. Technology Tools: Utilize technology to help you plan and manage your tasks efficiently. Calendar apps, task management software, and reminders can be valuable tools.
