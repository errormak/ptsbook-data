Episode 3: Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything

In Brian Tracy's  Eat That Frog!  book, the third concept is  Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything.  This concept is based on the Pareto Principle, which states that roughly 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Here's how you can apply this principle to your daily life:

1. Identify the Vital Few: Start by identifying the tasks, activities, or projects that have the most significant impact on your goals and outcomes. These are the  vital few  that belong to the 20% category.

2. Focus on High-Value Tasks: Allocate the majority of your time and energy to these high-value tasks. Prioritize them over less important activities that fall into the 80% category.

3. Eliminate or Delegate the Trivial Many: Recognize that not all tasks are created equal. The  trivial many  tasks in the 80% category may be less critical or time-consuming. Consider delegating them to others, automating them, or eliminating them altogether if they don't contribute significantly to your goals.

4. Evaluate Regularly: Continuously assess how you're allocating your time and effort. Are you still focusing on the vital few, or have you become sidetracked by less important tasks? Adjust your priorities as needed.

5. Concentrated Effort: Apply intense, focused effort to your high-impact tasks. Avoid multitasking and distractions. By concentrating on the vital few, you'll achieve more in less time.
