Episode 10: Doing: Making the Best Action Choices (Part 2)

In  Getting Things Done  by David Allen, Part 2 dives into the critical phase of  Doing.  This phase is all about making the best action choices once you have collected, processed, organized, and reviewed your tasks and commitments. Here's what you need to understand about this phase:

The Essence of Doing: At its core,  Doing  is about executing the tasks and actions you've identified as necessary to move your projects and goals forward. This phase is where the rubber meets the road, and you take tangible steps toward achieving your desired outcomes.

Contextual Lists: One of the key principles of the GTD method is organizing your tasks by context. Contexts are specific situations or locations where you can perform certain actions. For example, tasks that require a phone call can be grouped under the  Calls  context. This allows you to be efficient and choose actions based on your current context.

The Two-Minute Rule: Allen introduces the  Two-Minute Rule,  which is a simple but powerful concept. If a task can be completed in two minutes or less, it should be done immediately. This prevents small tasks from accumulating and cluttering your to-do lists.

Choosing Actions with Confidence: GTD emphasizes that you should have confidence in the actions you choose to tackle. By following the GTD process of collection, processing, organization, and review, you've already ensured that your actions are aligned with your goals and priorities.

Resisting the Urge to Multitask: Multitasking is discouraged in GTD because it can reduce productivity and increase stress. Instead, focus on one task at a time, guided by your current context and priorities.

Calendar-Based Actions: While most tasks are organized by context, some actions are time-sensitive and should be placed on your calendar. These are appointments or commitments that must be honored at specific times or on specific dates.

Handling Interruptions: GTD acknowledges that interruptions are a part of work and life. The key is to handle them mindfully and make quick decisions about whether to address them immediately, defer them, delegate them, or capture them for later processing.
