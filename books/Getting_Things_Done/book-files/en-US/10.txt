Episode 9: Reviewing: Keeping Your System Functional 

In  Getting Things Done  by David Allen, Part 2 explores the critical concept of reviewing, which is essential for maintaining a functional and effective productivity system. Here's what you need to know from this section:

The Purpose of Regular Reviews: Regular reviews are the glue that holds your GTD system together. They ensure that your trusted organizational tools stay current and functional. The purpose of these reviews is to keep your commitments and tasks aligned with your goals and priorities.

Daily Mini-Review: A mini-review at the beginning and end of your day is essential. It allows you to reassess your commitments, update your to-do lists, and ensure that you're working on the most important tasks. It also helps you start and end your day with clarity.

Weekly Review: The weekly review is the most crucial review session in the GTD methodology. Typically, it should take about 1-2 hours. During the weekly review, you go through several key steps:

Collect Loose Papers: Gather any loose papers, notes, or items that need processing.
Empty Your Head: Write down any new tasks, ideas, or commitments that have arisen during the week.
Process Your Inboxes: Go through your physical and digital inboxes, clarifying and organizing the items they contain.
Review Your Calendar: Review the past week and the upcoming week on your calendar to ensure you're aware of all appointments and deadlines.
Review Your Projects: Go through each project and ensure that you have identified the next actions required to move them forward.
Review Your  Waiting For  List: Follow up on any items you're waiting for from others.
Review Your  Someday/Maybe  List: Reflect on any potential projects or ideas you may want to pursue in the future.
Review Your Action Lists: Ensure that your next actions lists are up to date, and you have clear tasks to work on during the upcoming week.
The Benefits of Regular Reviews: Regular reviews have several benefits. They help you:

Maintain clarity and focus on your goals and priorities.
Reduce the risk of missing deadlines or commitments.
Identify any incomplete or stalled projects.
Eliminate redundancy and ensure you're not duplicating efforts.
Stay in control of your workload and reduce stress.
