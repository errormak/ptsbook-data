Episode 9: The Philosophy of the Desert 

In Part 3 of "The Alchemist," Santiago continues his journey through the desert with the alchemist as his guide. 
As they traverse the vast and unforgiving landscape, the alchemist imparts profound wisdom about the nature of the desert. 
He explains that the desert is a place where everything is stripped down to its essential elements. It is a place of both danger and opportunity, 
where one must learn to read the signs of the desert to survive. Santiago begins to understand that the desert represents a metaphorical journey of self-discovery, 
where he must confront his innermost fears and desires.
