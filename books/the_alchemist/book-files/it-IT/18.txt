Episode 17: Santiago's Return to the Church 

In the fifth and final part of "The Alchemist," Santiago returns to the old church in Spain where his journey began. As he gazes at the sycamore tree, 
he reflects on the profound transformation he has undergone. Santiago realizes that the treasure he was seeking was not buried at the Egyptian pyramids but was, 
in fact, the wisdom, self-discovery, and spiritual growth he gained on his journey.

He understands that the journey itself was the treasure, and that every step he took was a step toward fulfilling his Personal Legend. 
Santiago feels a deep sense of gratitude and contentment as he reconnects with the essence of his homeland and the lessons of the journey.
