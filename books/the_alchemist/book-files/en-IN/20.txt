Episode 19: Santiago's Final Lesson 

Santiago's journey has come full circle as he reflects on the lessons he has learned. He shares his wisdom with a group of young shepherds who, 
like him at the beginning of the story, are hesitant to leave their comfort zone. Santiago encourages them to listen to their hearts and embark on their 
own journeys in pursuit of their dreams. He imparts the idea that the entire universe conspires to help those who are true to their desires.
