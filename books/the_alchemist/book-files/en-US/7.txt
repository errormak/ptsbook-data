Episode 6: The Oasis and the Soul of the World 

Santiago arrives at the oasis, an oasis that is both a physical place and a metaphor for the soul of the world. 
Here, he meets the beautiful and enchanting Fatima, with whom he falls in love. Santiago also encounters the Al-Fayoum oasis's chief, 
who introduces him to the concept of the  Soul of the World.  According to the chief, everything on Earth is connected through this universal soul, 
and it communicates through omens and signs. Santiago's experiences at the oasis deepen his understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and 
the importance of listening to the language of the world.
