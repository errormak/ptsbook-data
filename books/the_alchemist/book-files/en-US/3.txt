Episode 2: Santiago's Encounter with Melchizedek 

As Santiago leaves behind the hills of Andalusia, he encounters Melchizedek, the King of Salem, who is also a mysterious and wise figure.
 Melchizedek introduces Santiago to the concept of the  Personal Legend.  He explains that each person has a unique purpose or treasure to discover in life, 
which he calls the Personal Legend. Santiago's dream of the treasure is, in fact, a call to fulfill his Personal Legend.

Melchizedek provides Santiago with two stones, Urim and Thummim, to help him make decisions on his journey. 
These stones represent the importance of listening to one's heart and intuition. 
Santiago's meeting with Melchizedek reinforces his commitment to follow his dream and discover his Personal Legend, despite the challenges that lie ahead.
