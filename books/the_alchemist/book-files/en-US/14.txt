Episode 13: The Power of Transformation 

In Part 4 of "The Alchemist," Santiago and the alchemist face the ultimate test as they stand before the Egyptian pyramids. 
Santiago believes that the treasure he seeks is buried here, and he begins to dig fervently. However, after hours of digging, they find nothing. 
Santiago is devastated and questions the validity of his dream.

The alchemist reassures Santiago that the journey itself has been the real treasure. He explains that the true alchemy lies in the 
transformation that occurs within an individual during their pursuit of a dream. Santiago begins to realize that he has undergone a profound transformation, 
gaining wisdom, self-awareness, and a deep connection to the world around him.
