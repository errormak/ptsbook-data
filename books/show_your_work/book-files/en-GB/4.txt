Episode 3: Share Something Small Every Day

In  Chapter 3: Share Something Small Every Day,  Austin Kleon encourages creators to embrace the practice of sharing their work consistently and regularly. He emphasizes that sharing doesn't have to be a grand or time-consuming endeavor; even small, incremental updates can make a significant impact.

Kleon introduces the idea that by sharing something daily, creators keep their audience engaged and informed about their progress. Sharing small steps of the creative journey allows others to follow along and become invested in the process.

The chapter highlights the benefits of establishing a routine of sharing. It not only builds a sense of accountability but also encourages the development of a creative habit. Kleon argues that consistency is key to growing an audience and gaining recognition.

Kleon provides practical advice on how to implement this principle, such as using social media, blogs, or other platforms to share updates regularly. He suggests that creators can document their work, thoughts, or creative discoveries and share them with their audience. The key is to make sharing a daily practice, no matter how small the contribution may seem.
