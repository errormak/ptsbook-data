"Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki is a groundbreaking personal finance book that challenges conventional beliefs about money, investing, and achieving financial
success. With its unique storytelling approach and transformative insights, the book has become a cornerstone for those seeking to escape the cycle of financial
struggle and achieve true prosperity.

The introduction of the book introduces us to the author's two father figures: his biological father, whom he calls the "Poor Dad," and the father of his best 
friend, referred to as the "Rich Dad." These two figures symbolize contrasting attitudes towards money and wealth accumulation, forming the foundation for the 
lessons that follow.
