episode 2 :Why Teach Financial Literacy?

In this part of  Rich Dad, Poor Dad,  Robert Kiyosaki delves deeper into the importance of financial education and why it is crucial to teach financial literacy to individuals of all ages, especially children. He believes that the traditional education system largely ignores financial education, leaving many people ill-equipped to navigate the complexities of money and wealth.

Kiyosaki argues that the lack of financial education perpetuates a cycle of financial struggle for many families. He points out that people are often told to save money, work hard, and live below their means, but they are not taught how to make their money work for them. This lack of knowledge about money management, investing, and building assets keeps individuals stuck in the  rat race,  where they work for money their entire lives.

One of the central themes in this section is the idea that understanding the difference between assets and liabilities is the foundation of financial literacy. Kiyosaki emphasizes that many people misclassify their possessions, such as homes and cars, as assets when they are, in fact, liabilities because they generate expenses instead of income.

Kiyosaki advocates for a shift in mindset, encouraging readers to prioritize financial education and actively seek opportunities to increase their financial intelligence. He believes that teaching financial literacy should begin at home and be reinforced in schools, as it equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to make informed financial decisions.
