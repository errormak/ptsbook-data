Introduction

In the introduction to "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," Stephen R. Covey sets the stage by sharing a powerful lesson from his own life. 
He describes an experience on a New York City subway when he observed a man with his unruly children, seemingly indifferent to their disruptive behavior. 
However, Covey's perspective changed when he realized that the father was mourning the recent loss of his wife. 
This realization led Covey to reflect on the nature of principles and paradigms.

Covey introduces the concept of "inside-out" thinking, emphasizing that true change and effectiveness come from a shift in one's character, mindset, and principles. 
He challenges readers to examine their own paradigms and offers the promise that by embracing the seven habits outlined in the book, they can transform their lives, 
both personally and professionally.
