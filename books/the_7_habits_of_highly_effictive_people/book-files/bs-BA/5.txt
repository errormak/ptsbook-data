Episode 3: The Second Habit: Begin with the End in Mind

In the second habit, "Begin with the End in Mind," Covey introduces the concept of having a clear and well-defined vision of what we want to achieve in our lives. 
He emphasizes the importance of setting personal and professional goals based on our values and principles.

Covey encourages readers to create a personal mission statementâ€”an articulation of their core values, long-term goals, and guiding principles. 
This mission statement serves as a compass, guiding our decisions and actions in alignment with our desired destination.

By beginning with the end in mind, we gain clarity about our life's purpose and can set meaningful goals that are consistent with our values. 
This habit empowers us to make choices that are in harmony with our principles, ensuring that our actions contribute to a more purposeful and fulfilling life.
