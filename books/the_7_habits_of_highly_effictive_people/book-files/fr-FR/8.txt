Episode 6: The Fifth Habit: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood

In the fifth habit, "Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood," Covey underscores the importance of empathetic communication. 
He introduces the concept of the "Emotional Bank Account," which represents the trust and goodwill in relationships.

Covey emphasizes that most people tend to "Listen with the intent to reply" rather than genuinely understanding others. He introduces the skill of empathetic listening,
 which involves seeking to understand the perspective, feelings, and needs of others before expressing our own views.

The habit encourages a profound shift from a "Tell me your story" approach to a "Let me understand your story" approach in interactions. Covey argues that this
 empathetic listening builds trust and rapport, enabling more effective communication and problem-solving.
