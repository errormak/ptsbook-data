Episode 7: The Walls of Babylon 

Dabasir, a successful merchant in Babylon, sought advice from Arkad on how to safeguard his wealth. 
Arkad explained that while saving and investing were vital, protecting one's wealth was equally important.

Arkad told Dabasir about the "Fifth Cure for a Lean Purse," which emphasized the importance of safeguarding wealth through wise and prudent measures. 
He likened it to protecting a city's treasures by maintaining its walls.

Dabasir understood the analogy. He realized that, just as the wealth of a city could protect its citizens, protecting his assets would ensure his financial security. 
He began to take measures to protect his wealth, such as diversifying his investments and acquiring insurance for his business ventures.
