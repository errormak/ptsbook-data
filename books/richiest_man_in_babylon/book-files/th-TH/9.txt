Episode 8: The Camel Trader of Babylon 

In this episode, a man named Hadan Gula, known for his trade in camels, sought advice from Arkad. 
Hadan Gula had amassed a considerable sum of money from his camel trade but was unsure how to manage it wisely.

Arkad shared the wisdom of the "Sixth Cure for a Lean Purse," which advised individuals to make their dwellings profitable investments.
 He explained that owning property or investing in one's home could increase its value over time, providing a source of wealth.

Hadan Gula took this advice to heart. He decided to invest in properties near the growing city of Babylon, and over the years, 
the value of his real estate holdings increased significantly. He learned that by making smart real estate investments, he could ensure a more secure financial future.
