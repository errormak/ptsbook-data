Episode 4: Meet the Goddess of Good Luck 

Bansir and Kobbi, fueled by their newfound knowledge, decided to put their savings to work. 
They had heard of a lucrative opportunity: a distant city was in need of chariots for a grand celebration.
 Bansir and Kobbi believed this was their chance to make a substantial profit and quickly decided to invest their savings in producing chariots.

Excitement filled their hearts as they embarked on this venture. They poured their money into the project and worked tirelessly, hoping for success. 
However, their lack of experience in chariot production soon became evident. Materials were wasted, labor was inefficient, and the venture began to bleed their savings.

One day, while discussing their concerns with Arkad, he reminded them of the importance of the  Fourth Cure for a Lean Purse : 
guarding their treasures from loss. Bansir and Kobbi realized that they had overlooked this crucial principle. 
They had rushed into an unfamiliar business without seeking expert advice and without fully understanding the risks.

Arkad advised them to seek counsel from experienced chariot makers and to make more informed decisions in the future. 
They learned that while luck could play a role, it was wise planning and knowledge that ensured lasting success.
