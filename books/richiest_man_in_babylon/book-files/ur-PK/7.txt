Episode 6: The Gold Lender of Babylon 

Arkad's teachings continued to shape the financial perspectives of Bansir and Kobbi. 
In the midst of their chariot-building challenges, they faced a shortage of funds and decided to borrow money to keep their project afloat.

Seeking advice from Arkad once more, they learned about the importance of responsible lending. 
Arkad shared the wisdom of lending money only to those who could repay it and charging interest to ensure a profitable return. 
He also emphasized the value of maintaining accurate records, like the clay tablets of Babylon, to track loans, repayments, and interest rates.

Bansir and Kobbi began to apply these principles to their chariot venture. They became more cautious about whom they lent to, 
and they kept meticulous records of their financial transactions. 
This newfound discipline not only helped them recover from their initial losses but also ensured a steady income stream through interest earnings.

These episodes illustrate that the path to wealth is not always smooth, but with the right principles and knowledge,
 individuals can overcome challenges and build a secure financial future.
