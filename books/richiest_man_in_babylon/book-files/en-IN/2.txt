Episode 1: The Man Who Desired Gold 

In ancient Babylon, there lived a man named Bansir who toiled day and night as a chariot builder. 
Despite his hard work, he struggled to make ends meet and dreamed of acquiring wealth. 
One day, Bansir met his childhood friend, Kobbi, who had become a successful musician.

Kobbi noticed Bansir's distress and introduced him to a wealthy man named Arkad, known as the richest man in Babylon.
 Arkad agreed to share his wisdom with Bansir, gathering a group of eager young men, including Kobbi, to listen.

With great enthusiasm, Arkad began by emphasizing the importance of saving. 
He introduced the concept of the  First Cure for a Lean Purse,  advising everyone to save at least 10% of their income. 
This 10% was not to be touched but invested wisely.

Bansir and the others were intrigued. They realized that the first step toward wealth was to pay themselves first, 
setting aside a portion of their earnings before they paid for anything else. This concept, they understood, laid the foundation for their financial future.
