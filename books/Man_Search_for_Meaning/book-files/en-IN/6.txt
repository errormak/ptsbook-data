Episode 5: Freedom of Will

Central to logotherapy is the idea that humans possess the freedom of will, the ability to choose their responses to life's challenges. This episode delves into Frankl's assertion that, regardless of external circumstances, individuals retain the power to decide their attitudes and actions. We explore how this freedom of will allows individuals to find meaning in suffering and create a sense of purpose. Frankl's emphasis on personal responsibility and choice challenges us to recognize our capacity to shape our own lives, even in adversity.
