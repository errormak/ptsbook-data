Conclusion: The Statue in the Park

In the conclusion of  Man's Search for Meaning,  Frankl reflects on his life after the Holocaust and the development of logotherapy. He tells a poignant story about a young girl who visited him after reading one of his books. She explained that she had considered taking her own life but was inspired by Frankl's ideas to find meaning and hope in her circumstances.

Frankl then discusses a statue he once saw in a park, which depicted a man with his head bowed low. He explains that meaning can be found not only in the grand pursuits of life but also in the everyday moments of human existence. It is in these small, seemingly insignificant moments that individuals have the opportunity to experience profound meaning.
