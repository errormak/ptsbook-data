Episode 4: The Essence of Logotherapy

In this episode, we delve into the essence of logotherapy, a therapeutic approach developed by Viktor Frankl during his time in concentration camps and later refined in his clinical practice. Logotherapy is founded on the belief that the primary human drive is the search for meaning. We explore how Frankl's personal experiences in the camps shaped his understanding of the human psyche and the crucial role of meaning in mental health and well-being. Frankl's insights reveal that even in the most extreme circumstances, individuals can find purpose and derive strength from the belief that life has meaning.
