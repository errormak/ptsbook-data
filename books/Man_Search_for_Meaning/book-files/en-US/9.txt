Episode 8: Maintaining Inner Freedom

In this episode, we explore how Frankl's concept of  inner freedom  is essential for psychological health in the camp environment. Frankl argues that even when stripped of external freedoms, individuals can maintain their inner freedomâ€”the freedom to choose their attitude toward suffering. We examine the role of attitude and perspective in shaping one's mental state, even in the face of unimaginable hardship.
