Episode 10: The Importance of Meaning

Frankl's central thesis is that the search for meaning is a fundamental human endeavor. In this episode, we explore how meaning served as a lifeline for camp inmates. Frankl argues that those who had a sense of purpose, a reason to live, were more likely to survive and withstand the brutality of camp life. We examine personal anecdotes and case studies that illustrate the transformative power of meaning in the most dire circumstances.
