episode 31: The Stoic view of pleasure and desire.

In Book 7 of  Meditations  by Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic view of pleasure and desire is explored as a central theme. Marcus Aurelius, a prominent Stoic philosopher and the Roman Emperor, provides insights into how Stoicism approaches these aspects of human life. Here's a detailed view of the Stoic perspective on pleasure and desire as presented in the book:

1. Control of Desires:
Stoicism emphasizes the importance of exercising control over one's desires. Marcus Aurelius advises that individuals should not be slaves to their desires but rather should cultivate self-discipline. He acknowledges that desires are natural but cautions against letting them dictate one's actions.

2. Seeking Virtue over Pleasure:
Stoicism prioritizes the pursuit of virtue over the pursuit of pleasure. According to the Stoic philosophy, true and lasting happiness is found in living a virtuous life, characterized by wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. Pleasure, on the other hand, is considered a fleeting and often misleading sensation.

3. Tranquility and Equanimity:
Stoicism teaches that inner tranquility and emotional equanimity are superior to the fleeting pleasures of the senses. By detaching oneself from the pursuit of sensual pleasure and external rewards, individuals can attain a state of inner peace that is less susceptible to external circumstances.

4. Recognizing the Ephemeral Nature of Pleasure:
Aurelius reminds readers that pleasure, like all external things, is transitory. The joy derived from pleasurable experiences is often short-lived and can lead to dissatisfaction when it fades. Stoicism encourages individuals to recognize the impermanence of such pleasures and not to become overly attached to them.

5. Mastery Over One's Reactions:
Stoicism teaches that individuals have the power to choose how they react to external stimuli, including pleasures and desires. Instead of being controlled by their desires, Stoics strive for self-mastery and the ability to respond to life's circumstances with rationality and virtue.

6. Virtuous Pleasures:
While Stoicism discourages the pursuit of sensual or hedonistic pleasures, it acknowledges the existence of  virtuous pleasures.  These are pleasures that align with a virtuous and moral life. For example, the pleasure derived from acts of kindness, wisdom, or artistic expression is considered virtuous and in harmony with Stoic principles.

7. Freedom from Craving:
Stoicism encourages individuals to free themselves from the constant craving for external pleasures or possessions. This liberation from desire allows for a greater sense of inner freedom and contentment, as one is not perpetually seeking something outside of oneself for happiness.

8. Accepting Discomfort:
Stoics are taught to endure discomfort and even pain with resilience. They understand that the pursuit of virtue may require sacrificing immediate pleasure for long-term fulfillment. This acceptance of discomfort contributes to their inner strength and character development.

9. A Balanced Approach:
Aurelius promotes a balanced approach to life, recognizing that while the pursuit of virtue is paramount, some degree of pleasure is natural and acceptable. Stoicism encourages individuals to enjoy life's simple pleasures but to do so with moderation and without attachment.
