episode 4: Reflecting on one's own mortality

In Book 1 of  Meditations  by Marcus Aurelius, the author reflects on the concept of one's own mortality. Here's an expanded view of this theme:

Marcus Aurelius frequently contemplates the impermanence of life and the inevitability of death throughout  Meditations.  He believes that acknowledging one's mortality is a powerful source of wisdom and a way to live a more meaningful and virtuous life.

Aurelius reminds himself and his readers that life is fleeting and that death is an inescapable part of the human experience. This reflection serves as a humbling reminder that no one is exempt from the natural course of life, regardless of their status, wealth, or achievements.

By acknowledging our mortality, Aurelius argues that we gain perspective on the relative unimportance of many of the concerns that preoccupy our minds. Trivial worries and petty grievances lose their significance in the face of the ultimate certainty of death. This realization encourages us to prioritize what truly matters and to focus on the present moment.

Aurelius also suggests that reflecting on mortality can help us live with greater purpose and virtue. Recognizing the limited time we have on this Earth, he encourages us to make the most of our lives by cultivating virtues like wisdom, courage, and compassion. This, in turn, contributes to our own growth and the betterment of society.

Furthermore, the awareness of our own mortality can lead to a more profound appreciation of the present moment. Aurelius advises us to savor each day, cherish our relationships, and live with intention. By doing so, we can find fulfillment and contentment in the knowledge that we are making the most of the time we have.
